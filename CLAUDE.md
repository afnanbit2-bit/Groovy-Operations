# Groovy Operations — Claude session notes

Multi-file SPA, deployed to Netlify on every push to `main`.
Two contributors: Afnan (HRM/operations side, with Claude) and Ammar Shah
(printing/embellishments side, also with Claude on a separate session).

## File architecture (split from the old single `index.html`)

```
/index.html          shell only: <head>, CSS link, body DOM (login/setup/app),
                     CDN libs, ordered <script src> tags, and ONE inline
                     <script type="module"> that imports the Firebase modular
                     SDK, bridges db/auth/rtdb + all Firestore/RTDB fns onto
                     window, then calls window.__bootApp().
/css/main.css        all styles (extracted verbatim).
/js/shared.js        constants, generic utils (showToast, _icon,
                     formatTime12hr, logActivity, uploadToCloudinary), nav
                     (buildNav, mob nav, sheets), router (showPage,
                     renderPage), bug tracker, and window.__bootApp (holds
                     the 5 load-order-sensitive blocks: showPage wrap,
                     toggleNotifPanel wrap, outside-click, Escape/swipe,
                     onAuthStateChanged).
/js/print-engine.js  shared print/PDF design system (foundational). Public
                     API window.printDocument(); internal _render* components;
                     PRINT_COLORS/FONTS/SIZES/LAYOUT constants. See "Print
                     design system" section below.
/js/auth.js          USER_DEFS, doLogin/doLogout, showSetup/showLogin,
                     runSetup, startApp, renderUsers, permission helpers.
/js/pos.js           loadData/loadBundles, PO create/registry/detail,
                     stage work (cutting/bundling/QC), generatePOPdf.
/js/embellishments.js Ammar's track: recipes, Observer Tower, embellishment
                     jobs, color library, QC reports, billing,
                     loadPrintingData, renderDashboard.
/js/hrm.js           Afnan's track: HRM seed/load, attendance, employees,
                     payroll, advances, loans, policy, HRM notifications.
/js/store.js         store items/transactions/log/templates, fabric
                     inventory, REST helpers, store notifications.
/js/gatepass.js      gate passes, returns, fabric-in, GP edit/approval,
                     generateGPPdf, generateJobSheetPDF.
/js/fulfillment.js   Daily Performance track: per-day dispatch & returns
                     entry + analytics + date-wise Log (loadFulfillmentData,
                     renderFulfillmentPage). Firestore `fulfillment_reports`,
                     one doc per day (id = YYYY-MM-DD). Owners/managers +
                     the scoped `fulfillment` role (Umair). Per-day PDF via
                     the print engine `daily-performance` variant
                     (window.fulfillPdf).
/js/activity.js      activity log loader.
```

Load order is fixed in `index.html`:
`shared → print-engine → auth → pos → embellishments → hrm → store →
gatepass → activity`, then the bootstrap module. All `/js/*.js` are **plain global classic
scripts — no `import`/`export`**. They share one global lexical scope, so
top-level `let/const` are visible across files (declared exactly once);
top-level `function`/`var` also become `window.*`. Firebase is the ONLY ES
module, isolated to the bootstrap in `index.html`; everything else uses the
`window`-bridged `db`, `auth`, `rtdb`, `setDoc`, `doc`, `collection`,
`query`, `where`, `orderBy`, `getDocs`, `updateDoc`, … globals.

Anything that ran at module load time and depended on cross-file order or
Firebase (the 5 hoisted blocks) lives in `window.__bootApp()` in
`shared.js`, invoked by the module **after** the Firebase→window bridge and
**after** all classic scripts have parsed.

## Stack

- Frontend: vanilla JS (classic global scripts) — see File architecture above
- Auth: Firebase Auth (project `groovy-gatepass`)
- DB: Cloud Firestore + Realtime Database (RTDB used only for attendance)
- Images: Cloudinary, unsigned preset `groovy-ops`
- PDF: jsPDF · Excel: SheetJS (both via CDN)
- Hosting: Netlify (auto-deploy on push to `main`)

## Print design system

Foundational shared engine for ALL print/PDF output. **Every future print
output (Production Order, Embroidery Vendor Sheet, Sublimation Vendor Sheet,
Gate Pass, QC Report, Placement Sheet, …) MUST route through this engine —
do not call jsPDF directly for new print features.**

- **Location:** `/js/print-engine.js` — plain global classic script, loaded
  in `index.html` AFTER `shared.js` and BEFORE `auth.js` / all domain files.
- **Fonts:** self-hosted in `/assets/fonts/` — Aptos (regular/bold/italic/
  bold-italic), Aptos Display (regular/bold), Jameel Noori Nastaleeq
  (regular/bold). `@font-face` (screen, `font-display:swap`) lives at the top
  of `css/main.css`; the engine embeds the same TTFs into PDFs via
  `addFileToVFS()` + `addFont()`. **7 of 8 fonts are real:** all four Aptos
  weights (`BoldItalic` = bold), `AptosDisplay-Regular` (= Aptos SemiBold),
  `AptosDisplay-Bold` (= Aptos Black) and `JameelNooriNastaleeq-Regular`
  (~10 MB) are real; only `JameelNooriNastaleeq-Bold` is still a placeholder
  stub (bold-Urdu source unavailable). Validation is per-file, so the engine
  embeds all real fonts and falls back to Helvetica only for that one stub
  (nothing breaks); screen uses the CSS fallback stack. See
  `/assets/fonts/FONT_INSTALL.md`. Known jsPDF limit: Urdu is drawn unshaped
  even with the JNN TTF embedded; also the ~10 MB JNN Regular is base64'd
  into every Urdu PDF, so those PDFs are large.
- **Public API (only global):**
  `window.printDocument({ type, data, filename })` where `type` ∈
  `po | embroidery-vendor | sublimation-vendor | gate-pass |
  placement-sheet | qc-report | generic`. **Implemented variants:**
  `generic` (fallback) and ✅ **`gate-pass`** (single-page bilingual
  transit document — `_renderGatePass`, dispatched via the `_VARIANTS`
  registry in `printDocument`). Any not-yet-built type logs a
  `console.warn` and renders the generic fallback (header + optional hero
  title + `data.bodyHtml` as text + bilingual footer). Opens the PDF in a
  new tab AND triggers download. The pre-opened tab shows a `_previewLoading`
  interim page (never a stark `about:blank`) during the font fetch/subset,
  and `_previewError` renders a readable failure page instead of a
  blank/closed tab. Remaining variant builders reuse the components below.
- **Internal components (NOT global; JSDoc'd in the file):**
  `_renderHeader`, `_renderFooter` (auto every page via `_stampFooters`),
  `_renderSectionHeader`, `_renderBilingualLabel`, `_renderInfoTable`,
  `_renderSignatureRow`, `_renderDivider`, `_renderTitleBlock`. They read
  `doc.__groovyFonts` (font resolver), `doc.__groovyDocType` (footer label)
  and maintain `doc.__groovyY` (running content cursor).
- **Constants:** `PRINT_COLORS`, `PRINT_FONTS`, `PRINT_SIZES`,
  `PRINT_LAYOUT` (A4 portrait in points: 595×842, 36pt margins,
  523pt content width) — declared at the top of `print-engine.js`.
- **Conditional Urdu embedding (`data.urduLevel`):** per-document flag
  `'none' | 'minimal' | 'full'` controlling whether the ~10 MB Jameel Noori
  Nastaleeq TTF is fetched + embedded. `'full'` fetches/embeds JNN and
  renders full bilingual output; `'minimal'`/`'none'` never download or
  embed JNN — the footer is English-only (`GROOVY · {documentType} ·
  Internal Use Only · Confidential`) and every bilingual component
  (`_renderFooter`, `_renderSectionHeader`, `_renderBilingualLabel`,
  `_renderInfoTable`, `_renderSignatureRow`) silently drops its Urdu side
  (no tofu). Explicit `data.urduLevel` wins; otherwise the per-type default
  in `_PRINT_URDU_DEFAULTS` applies; an unknown type/level → `'minimal'`.
  `gate-pass` is **forced to `'full'`** regardless of caller input (the
  variant is inherently bilingual for gate guards/vendors). The footer Urdu
  tail is type-aware via `_footerUr(documentType)` /
  `_PRINT_FOOTER_UR_BY_TYPE` (Gate Pass → `گیٹ پاس — صرف اندرونی استعمال`,
  Production Order → `پروڈکشن آرڈر …`, else generic `صرف اندرونی استعمال`).
  Resolution sets `doc.__groovyUrdu` (the `_urduOn(doc)` flag components
  read) — a `'full'` request with JNN unavailable degrades to clean
  English-only, never tofu. Font fetch is split (`_fontCacheCore` always,
  `_fontCacheUrdu` lazily only on the first `'full'`). Per-render the engine
  serializes the PDF once and logs `[print-engine] Generated {type} PDF —
  urduLevel: {level}, size: ~{X}KB`.

  | Default `urduLevel` | Types |
  |---|---|
  | `minimal` | `generic`, `payroll-sheet`, `payslip`, `daily-performance` |
  | `full` | `gate-pass` (forced), `po`, `embroidery-vendor`, `sublimation-vendor`, `qc-report`, `placement-sheet` |

  Measured (same PO, real JNN): `minimal` ≈ 116 KB / 0 JNN fetch · `full`
  ≈ 552 KB / JNN fetched. jsPDF 2.5.1 subsets embedded TTFs so `full` is far
  below the raw 10 MB font; the main saving from `minimal` is skipping the
  ~10 MB **fetch** + base64 + subsetting work entirely.
- **Default path (shipped):** `window.__usePrintEngine` now defaults to
  `true` — all 5 legacy generators (`generatePOPdf`, `generateGPPdf`,
  `generateJobSheetPDF`, `exportPayrollPDF`, `downloadPayslipPDF`)
  short-circuit through `printDocument` (generic) by default. The legacy
  jsPDF code paths are **preserved as fallback only**, intact below each
  guard in `pos.js` / `gatepass.js` / `hrm.js`. Escape hatch: set
  `window.__usePrintEngine = false` in the browser console (or pre-load) to
  restore the old generators if anything breaks in production.

## Domain map — who owns what

### Afnan / HRM track (Claude) — owns `js/hrm.js`

All HRM track code lives in `js/hrm.js` (was previously in `index.html`):

- Employees, paygrades, increment logs (`employees`, `increment_logs`,
  `hrm_policies/main`)
- Attendance (RTDB `attendance/{date}/{k40}` + `attendance/live/{k40}`)
- Payroll engine (`payroll_runs`, `payslips`)
- Advances + loans (`advance_requests`, `loans`)
- Policy engine + change log (`policy_change_log`)
- HRM notification system (`hrm_notifications`) — bell on every page
- Bug tracker (`bug_reports`) — floating FAB on every page
- Worker dashboard ("Me" page, my-work HRM widget)
- Mobile nav redesign (5-button + bottom-sheet "More" pattern)
- Icon system (`_icon` SVG helper) + semantic accent palette
- ZKTeco sync script in `attendance-sync/`

### Ammar Shah / Embellishments track (Claude) — owns `js/embellishments.js`

All embellishments track code lives in `js/embellishments.js` (was
previously in `index.html`):

- Recipe directory + create + detail (`article_recipes`)
- Placement form (template-based, audience-specific worker views)
- Color library (`color_library`) + Pantone swatches
- Embellishment jobs + observer tower (`printing_jobs`)
- QC reports + billing (`qc_reports`, `printing_billing`)
- `PRINTING_RATE_MASTER` constant (~190 article codes) for tier auto-detect
- Monotone refactor of `STAGES`, `PRIORITY_COLORS`, badges → `#111`/`#f0f0f0`
- Mobile UI overhaul (commit 89994a0) — initial 44px touch targets,
  expanded media queries

### Shared / Operational (older code, neither owner exclusively)

- POs (`pos`, `bundles`)
- Gate passes (`gatepasses`, `returns`, `fabricin`)
- Store (`store_items`, `store_transactions`, `store_notifications`,
  `trim_templates`)
- Activity log (`activity`)
- Counters (`counters`)
- Users (`USER_DEFS` array — owners/managers/workers)

## Shopify Inventory Intelligence

Read-only sales + inventory dashboard ("Inventory Intel" page). Data is
pulled from the live Shopify store (`groovypakistan.com` / GROOVY™
Streetwear) into `shopify_*` Firestore collections by **Netlify
Functions** (Node, `firebase-admin`, service-account writes), then read
client-side.

- **Client (`js/shopify.js`):** `loadShopifyData()` + `renderShopifyDashboard()`.
  Read-only — never writes. Categories are derived **dynamically** from
  whatever `product_type` strings exist (no hardcoded category list / color
  map); blank/whitespace types fall into an `'Unknown'` bucket. The "By
  Category (7d)" panel is **line-item based** (keeps historical category by
  design); Weeks-of-Supply is **catalog/product based** and skips
  `status==='archived'` rows so the discontinued archive doesn't swamp
  `'Unknown'`.
- **Functions (`netlify/functions/`):** all auth to Shopify via Client
  Credentials Grant; env vars `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`,
  `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN`, `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`.
  - `shopify-catalog-sync.js` — **manual / on-demand HTTP function, NOT
    scheduled.** No auth header (handler ignores the event); a plain GET
    runs it. Trigger:
    `https://groovyoperations.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/shopify-catalog-sync`.
    Fetches all products (`status=active,draft,archived`) and writes **one
    doc per variant** to `shopify_products/{variant.id}` via
    `batch.set(...)` **without `{merge:true}`** → a re-sync **fully
    overwrites** every doc (incl. `product_type`), so a plain re-run is the
    backfill — no separate upsert path needed. Flags products whose options
    aren't `Color`/`Size` (`needs_review:true`); informational only. Writes
    a run summary to `shopify_sync_meta/catalog_sync`.
  - `shopify-inventory-snapshot.js` — scheduled daily (`0 1 * * *`).
  - `shopify-order-sync.js` — scheduled every 4h (`0 */4 * * *`).
  - `shopify-weekly-close.js` — scheduled Sat (`0 2 * * 6`).
  - `shopify-order-backfill.js` — resumable historical order backfill
    (BulkWriter, time-budgeted to dodge 502s); `shopify-inventory.js` —
    connection test. (Schedules live in `netlify.toml`.)
- **Collections:** `shopify_products` (per-variant catalog), `shopify_orders`,
  `shopify_line_items` (keep historical `product_type` by design),
  `shopify_inventory_snapshots`, `shopify_weekly_closes`, `shopify_sync_meta`.
  All are `read: if signedIn(); write: if false;` in `firestore.rules` —
  only the Admin SDK (Functions) writes; clients read-only.

## Shared touchpoints — coordinate before changing

These functions/blocks are edited by both tracks. Check the other branch
before pushing changes here. **`index.html` and `js/shared.js` are the
cross-track files — both tracks must coordinate on any change to these two
specifically**, since they hold the shell, the router, and the nav:

- `buildNav()` — lives in `js/shared.js` (the router/nav code); the nav DOM
  containers are wired in `index.html`. Both tracks add nav items here
- `renderPage(id)` switch — lives in `js/shared.js`; both tracks add page
  dispatch cases here
- `loadPrintingData()` (`js/embellishments.js`) / `loadHRMData()`,
  `loadHRMSession4Data()`, `loadPayrollData()` (`js/hrm.js`) /
  `loadBugReports()` (`js/shared.js`) — be careful with order
- `css/main.css`, especially the `@media (max-width: 600px)` block
- `_icon(name, size)` SVG set (`js/shared.js`) — add new icons not reuse
- `openMobSheet({title, items})` (`js/shared.js`) and the More-sheet list
- `:root` CSS variables in `css/main.css` — accents (`--accent-urgent`,
  `--accent-warning`, `--accent-success`) and radii (`--radius-card`,
  `--radius-bubble`)
- `window.__bootApp()` in `js/shared.js` — the 5 hoisted load-order blocks;
  do not move these back inline

## Permission helpers

Username-gated (not just role-gated). The HRM-ops ones (`_canViewPayroll`
etc.) live in `js/hrm.js`; the printing/role helpers (`isObserver`,
`isPrintWorker`, `isQCWorker`, `canManageRecipes`, …) live in `js/auth.js`:

- `_canViewPayroll()` → afnan, ammar, mustafa
- `_canProcessPayroll()` → afnan, ammar
- `_canViewHRMOps()` → afnan, ammar, mustafa (advances/loans/policy)
- `_canApproveHRMOps()` → afnan, ammar
- `_canEditPolicy()` → afnan, ammar

Plain role checks elsewhere:
- `session.role === 'owner' | 'manager' | 'store' | 'worker' | 'viewer'`
- Helpers: `isObserver()`, `isPrintWorker()`, `isStitchWorker()`,
  `isQCWorker()`, `isBundleWorker()`, `canManageRecipes()`, `canSeePrinting()`

## Outstanding action — Firestore rules not yet published

The repo's `firestore.rules` is the canonical version but the live rules
in Firebase Console have NOT been republished yet. Until that's done:

- Bug submissions fail with "Missing or insufficient permissions"
- Newer collections may also fail to write (advances, loans, policy log,
  payroll runs/slips, hrm_notifications, **`products`** — custom products
  added from the New PO form)

To fix: open
  https://console.firebase.google.com/project/groovy-gatepass/firestore/rules
replace contents with the contents of `firestore.rules` from the repo,
hit Publish, hard-refresh app on phones.

## Branch / merge workflow

- Each task is on a `claude/<task>` branch, then fast-forward into `main`
  and pushed. Sandbox cannot delete remote branches (HTTP 403), so feature
  branches accumulate on GitHub. Clean up at:
  https://github.com/afnanbit2-bit/Groovy-Operations/branches
- Ammar's track uses GitHub PRs (#9 through #16, #23 so far) merged to main.
- Both tracks push to the same `main`; Netlify deploys main automatically.

## Running locally

The app is now multi-file (`index.html` shell + `/css/main.css` + the
`/js/*.js` scripts), but there is still **no build step** — the files are
served as-is. `python -m http.server` from the repo root still works
exactly as before; open `http://localhost:8000/` (serving from the repo
root is required so the absolute `/css/...` and `/js/...` paths resolve).
The Firebase config in `index.html` points at the live `groovy-gatepass`
project, so any local writes hit the same Firestore as production. Read-only smoke tests are safe; destructive
flows (process payroll, mark paid, approve advances, mark bug fixed)
are NOT — they mutate live data.
