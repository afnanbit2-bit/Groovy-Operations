# Groovy Operations — Claude session notes

Multi-file SPA, deployed to Netlify on every push to `main`.
Two contributors: Afnan (HRM/operations side, with Claude) and Ammar Shah
(printing/embellishments side, also with Claude on a separate session).

## File architecture (split from the old single `index.html`)

```
/index.html          shell only: <head>, CSS link, body DOM (login/setup/app),
                     CDN libs, ordered <script src> tags, and ONE inline
                     <script type="module"> that imports the Firebase modular
                     SDK, bridges db/auth/rtdb + all Firestore/RTDB fns onto
                     window, then calls window.__bootApp().
/css/main.css        all styles (extracted verbatim).
/js/shared.js        constants, generic utils (showToast, _icon,
                     formatTime12hr, logActivity, uploadToCloudinary), nav
                     (buildNav, mob nav, sheets), router (showPage,
                     renderPage), bug tracker, and window.__bootApp (holds
                     the 5 load-order-sensitive blocks: showPage wrap,
                     toggleNotifPanel wrap, outside-click, Escape/swipe,
                     onAuthStateChanged).
/js/auth.js          USER_DEFS, doLogin/doLogout, showSetup/showLogin,
                     runSetup, startApp, renderUsers, permission helpers.
/js/pos.js           loadData/loadBundles, PO create/registry/detail,
                     stage work (cutting/bundling/QC), generatePOPdf.
/js/embellishments.js Ammar's track: recipes, Observer Tower, embellishment
                     jobs, color library, QC reports, billing,
                     loadPrintingData, renderDashboard.
/js/hrm.js           Afnan's track: HRM seed/load, attendance, employees,
                     payroll, advances, loans, policy, HRM notifications.
/js/store.js         store items/transactions/log/templates, fabric
                     inventory, REST helpers, store notifications.
/js/gatepass.js      gate passes, returns, fabric-in, GP edit/approval,
                     generateGPPdf, generateJobSheetPDF.
/js/activity.js      activity log loader.
```

Load order is fixed in `index.html`:
`shared → auth → pos → embellishments → hrm → store → gatepass → activity`,
then the bootstrap module. All `/js/*.js` are **plain global classic
scripts — no `import`/`export`**. They share one global lexical scope, so
top-level `let/const` are visible across files (declared exactly once);
top-level `function`/`var` also become `window.*`. Firebase is the ONLY ES
module, isolated to the bootstrap in `index.html`; everything else uses the
`window`-bridged `db`, `auth`, `rtdb`, `setDoc`, `doc`, `collection`,
`query`, `where`, `orderBy`, `getDocs`, `updateDoc`, … globals.

Anything that ran at module load time and depended on cross-file order or
Firebase (the 5 hoisted blocks) lives in `window.__bootApp()` in
`shared.js`, invoked by the module **after** the Firebase→window bridge and
**after** all classic scripts have parsed.

## Stack

- Frontend: vanilla JS (classic global scripts) — see File architecture above
- Auth: Firebase Auth (project `groovy-gatepass`)
- DB: Cloud Firestore + Realtime Database (RTDB used only for attendance)
- Images: Cloudinary, unsigned preset `groovy-ops`
- PDF: jsPDF · Excel: SheetJS (both via CDN)
- Hosting: Netlify (auto-deploy on push to `main`)

## Domain map — who owns what

### Afnan / HRM track (Claude) — owns `js/hrm.js`

All HRM track code lives in `js/hrm.js` (was previously in `index.html`):

- Employees, paygrades, increment logs (`employees`, `increment_logs`,
  `hrm_policies/main`)
- Attendance (RTDB `attendance/{date}/{k40}` + `attendance/live/{k40}`)
- Payroll engine (`payroll_runs`, `payslips`)
- Advances + loans (`advance_requests`, `loans`)
- Policy engine + change log (`policy_change_log`)
- HRM notification system (`hrm_notifications`) — bell on every page
- Bug tracker (`bug_reports`) — floating FAB on every page
- Worker dashboard ("Me" page, my-work HRM widget)
- Mobile nav redesign (5-button + bottom-sheet "More" pattern)
- Icon system (`_icon` SVG helper) + semantic accent palette
- ZKTeco sync script in `attendance-sync/`

### Ammar Shah / Embellishments track (Claude) — owns `js/embellishments.js`

All embellishments track code lives in `js/embellishments.js` (was
previously in `index.html`):

- Recipe directory + create + detail (`article_recipes`)
- Placement form (template-based, audience-specific worker views)
- Color library (`color_library`) + Pantone swatches
- Embellishment jobs + observer tower (`printing_jobs`)
- QC reports + billing (`qc_reports`, `printing_billing`)
- `PRINTING_RATE_MASTER` constant (~190 article codes) for tier auto-detect
- Monotone refactor of `STAGES`, `PRIORITY_COLORS`, badges → `#111`/`#f0f0f0`
- Mobile UI overhaul (commit 89994a0) — initial 44px touch targets,
  expanded media queries

### Shared / Operational (older code, neither owner exclusively)

- POs (`pos`, `bundles`)
- Gate passes (`gatepasses`, `returns`, `fabricin`)
- Store (`store_items`, `store_transactions`, `store_notifications`,
  `trim_templates`)
- Activity log (`activity`)
- Counters (`counters`)
- Users (`USER_DEFS` array — owners/managers/workers)

## Shared touchpoints — coordinate before changing

These functions/blocks are edited by both tracks. Check the other branch
before pushing changes here. **`index.html` and `js/shared.js` are the
cross-track files — both tracks must coordinate on any change to these two
specifically**, since they hold the shell, the router, and the nav:

- `buildNav()` — lives in `js/shared.js` (the router/nav code); the nav DOM
  containers are wired in `index.html`. Both tracks add nav items here
- `renderPage(id)` switch — lives in `js/shared.js`; both tracks add page
  dispatch cases here
- `loadPrintingData()` (`js/embellishments.js`) / `loadHRMData()`,
  `loadHRMSession4Data()`, `loadPayrollData()` (`js/hrm.js`) /
  `loadBugReports()` (`js/shared.js`) — be careful with order
- `css/main.css`, especially the `@media (max-width: 600px)` block
- `_icon(name, size)` SVG set (`js/shared.js`) — add new icons not reuse
- `openMobSheet({title, items})` (`js/shared.js`) and the More-sheet list
- `:root` CSS variables in `css/main.css` — accents (`--accent-urgent`,
  `--accent-warning`, `--accent-success`) and radii (`--radius-card`,
  `--radius-bubble`)
- `window.__bootApp()` in `js/shared.js` — the 5 hoisted load-order blocks;
  do not move these back inline

## Permission helpers

Username-gated (not just role-gated). The HRM-ops ones (`_canViewPayroll`
etc.) live in `js/hrm.js`; the printing/role helpers (`isObserver`,
`isPrintWorker`, `isQCWorker`, `canManageRecipes`, …) live in `js/auth.js`:

- `_canViewPayroll()` → afnan, ammar, mustafa
- `_canProcessPayroll()` → afnan, ammar
- `_canViewHRMOps()` → afnan, ammar, mustafa (advances/loans/policy)
- `_canApproveHRMOps()` → afnan, ammar
- `_canEditPolicy()` → afnan, ammar

Plain role checks elsewhere:
- `session.role === 'owner' | 'manager' | 'store' | 'worker' | 'viewer'`
- Helpers: `isObserver()`, `isPrintWorker()`, `isStitchWorker()`,
  `isQCWorker()`, `isBundleWorker()`, `canManageRecipes()`, `canSeePrinting()`

## Outstanding action — Firestore rules not yet published

The repo's `firestore.rules` is the canonical version but the live rules
in Firebase Console have NOT been republished yet. Until that's done:

- Bug submissions fail with "Missing or insufficient permissions"
- Newer collections may also fail to write (advances, loans, policy log,
  payroll runs/slips, hrm_notifications)

To fix: open
  https://console.firebase.google.com/project/groovy-gatepass/firestore/rules
replace contents with the contents of `firestore.rules` from the repo,
hit Publish, hard-refresh app on phones.

## Branch / merge workflow

- Each task is on a `claude/<task>` branch, then fast-forward into `main`
  and pushed. Sandbox cannot delete remote branches (HTTP 403), so feature
  branches accumulate on GitHub. Clean up at:
  https://github.com/afnanbit2-bit/Groovy-Operations/branches
- Ammar's track uses GitHub PRs (#9 through #16, #23 so far) merged to main.
- Both tracks push to the same `main`; Netlify deploys main automatically.

## Running locally

The app is now multi-file (`index.html` shell + `/css/main.css` + the
`/js/*.js` scripts), but there is still **no build step** — the files are
served as-is. `python -m http.server` from the repo root still works
exactly as before; open `http://localhost:8000/` (serving from the repo
root is required so the absolute `/css/...` and `/js/...` paths resolve).
The Firebase config in `index.html` points at the live `groovy-gatepass`
project, so any local writes hit the same Firestore as production. Read-only smoke tests are safe; destructive
flows (process payroll, mark paid, approve advances, mark bug fixed)
are NOT — they mutate live data.
